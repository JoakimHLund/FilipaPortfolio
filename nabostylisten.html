                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>Nabostylisten AS is an Oslo based company, founded in 2022. Their website allows for customers to contact stylists and have beauty services delivered to a desired location. Nabostylisten‚Äôs goal is to make beauty services more accessible and to make it easier for stylists to find clients.</p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Nabostylisten aimed to improve their mobile user experience and simplify their booking process. Our team followed the multiple stages of the Design Thinking Process from the Nielsen Norman Group, and our redesign was later presented to the owners and team of Nabostylisten, providing them with valuable insights and ideas.</p>

                        <h2>Gathering Insights üîç</h2>
                        <p>Our team set out to identify the goals and needs of beauty stylists and costumers, and to understand why Nabostylisten experienced a high number of dropouts on their booking flow. To achieve this, we conducted interviews with beauty service enthusiasts and stylists, administrated a client survey and performed an early usability test on Nabostylisten‚Äôs current website. All data was analyzed through affinity mapping and atomic research. </p>

                        <h3>Main Findings</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li> There are too many beauty services and it‚Äôs hard for costumers to understand what they all are. Therefore, ensuring the website has clear labeling is crucial to make it more user-friendly;</li>
                            <li> Clarifying the booking process through intuitive design and clear guidelines is also essential for efficiency and user satisfaction.</li>

                    <h2>User Personas üòä</h2>
                    <p>Based on the data collected from our research, we created two user personas, to represent costumers and stylists. This allowed us to maintain a user-centered approach by empathizing with their goals and needs..</p>

                    <p>At this stage of our design process, we facilitated two ideation workshops: one with the UX design class from Noroff and Nabostylisten, and another with our team and some classmates. The latter, organized by us, included a brain-walking activity using ‚ÄúHow Might We‚Äù questions. All data was analyzed through affinity mapping.</p>

                    <p>Redesigning the mobile booking flow for Nabostylisten was challenging. We not only had to learn how to work effectively as a team but were also still mastering the design process and had limited technical knowledge of Figma.</p>
                    <p>Our redesign proposal had technical mistakes and design flaws, but it was a valuable learning experience. It allowed us to master design patterns and best practices that proved useful in later projects.</p>
