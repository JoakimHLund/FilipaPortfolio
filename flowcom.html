                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>The public speaker industry in Norway is highly competitive and saturated, and booking rates are still low due to the economic effects of the Covid pandemic.</p>
                    <p>FlowCom delivers lectures and workshops to companies, enhancing their employees' skills and knowledge. This company is owned by Nina Hanssen, a journalist and author with over 12 years of public speaking experience.</p>

                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    <p>For this project I had the opportunity to work with a front-end developer and a marketing student. Together we developed a website for Nina Hanssen that showcases her work and simplifies the process of booking her for lectures and workshops.</p>

                    <p>I set out to identify the needs and goals of both public speakers and their clients. As such I conducted an exploratory interview with Nina Hanssen, literature review and collected client reviews. Lastly, I analyzed all data through affinity mapping and atomic research.</p>
