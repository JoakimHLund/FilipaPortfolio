                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>The public speaker industry in Norway is highly competitive and saturated, and booking rates are still low due to the economic effects of the Covid pandemic.</p>
                    <p>FlowCom delivers lectures and workshops to companies, enhancing their employees' skills and knowledge. This company is owned by Nina Hanssen, a journalist and author with over 12 years of public speaking experience.</p>

                    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                    <p>For this project I had the opportunity to work with a front-end developer and a marketing student. Together we developed a website for Nina Hanssen that showcases her work and simplifies the process of booking her for lectures and workshops.</p>

                    <p>I set out to identify the needs and goals of both public speakers and their clients. As such I conducted an exploratory interview with Nina Hanssen, literature review and collected client reviews. Lastly, I analyzed all data through affinity mapping and atomic research.</p>

Alongside the main stakeholder and our team, we included a communication student to leverage their expertise. Together we created a mind map with the ‚ÄúHow Might We‚Äù questions, that I later analyzed with an affinity map.</p>

                        <li>Nina Hanssen is the central focus of FlowCom, so she must be the website‚Äôs main highlight;</li>
                        <li>The website needs a clean and simple image, to convey professionalism and credibility;</li>
                        <li>Promoting Nina‚Äôs books and sharing client references might also help with establishing credibility.</li>

                    <p>To develop FlowCom, I held frequent meetings with the front-end developer. Together, we created low and mid-fidelity sketches to brainstorm potential layouts. Defining the information architecture and user flows was an iterative process involving continuous sketching and refinement.</p>

                    <p>FlowCom was implemented before the test stage to allow usability tests on a live product. I conducted four remote tests via video call, where participants were tasked with browsing the website and booking Nina Hanssen for a lecture or workshop.</p>

                    <p>FlowCom was a unique and valuable experience for me as a UX designer. It was my first opportunity to work with a multidisciplinary team and see my design implemented. Conducting user research, facilitating workshops, designing, and performing usability tests was a significant challenge, especially within a five-week timeframe.</p>
                    <p>This project is still ongoing, and I will continue to enhance it by incorporating suggestions from the usability tests and improving the mobile version.</p>
